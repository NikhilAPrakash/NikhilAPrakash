## Hi there, I am Nikhil👋

I'm an MSECE student at Northeastern University specializing in **Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and MLOps**.  
I build AI systems end-to-end — from data pipelines and orchestration (Airflow, Docker, DVC) to model development (PyTorch, TensorFlow, LLMs) and deployment on cloud.

### 🔭 What I'm working on
- **Optimizing Bluebikes Operations using Machine Learning based Demand predictions** (MLOps – Airflow, DVC, Docker, GCP)

### What I've Worked on
- **Benchmarking ML models for Boston Weekly Weather**
- **LINS LiDAR-Inertial SLAM** (ROS2, GTSAM, sensor fusion)
- AI agents for SEO & performance monitoring (TSC internship)

### 🧰 Tech Stack
**ML/AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, LightGBM, CatBoost, Scikit-learn  
**MLOps:** Docker, Airflow, DVC, MLflow, GitHub Actions, GCP  
**CV/Robotics:** OpenCV, ROS2, GTSAM, LiDAR, SLAM  
**Data:** Pandas, SQL  
**Other:** FastAPI
